+	  On embedded devices, often there is a combination of
+	  removable mmc devices (e.g. MMC/SD cards) and hard
+	  wired ones (e.g. eMMC). Depending on the hardware
+	  configuration, the 'mmcblkN' node might change if
+	  the removable device is available or not at boot time.
+
+	  E.g. if the removable device is attached at boot time,
+	  it might become mmxblk0. And the hard wired one mmcblk1.
+	  But if the removable device isn't there at boot time,
+	  the hard wired one will become mmcblk0. This makes it
+	  somehow difficult to hard code the root device to the
+	  non-removable device and boot fast.
+
+	  Enabling this option will simply associating 'N' of
+	  'mmcblkN' with the slot index instead of the dynamic
+	  name index. The slot index is always the same, ensuring
+	  that the non-removable mmc device is associated always
+	  with the same mmcblkN. Independent of the availability of
+	  the removable one.
+
+	  If unsure, say N here.
